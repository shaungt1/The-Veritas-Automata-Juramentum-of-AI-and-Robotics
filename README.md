# The-Veritas-Automata-Juramentum-of-AI-and-Robotics
> The purpose stated in the oath emphasizes the role of practitioners in the fields of computer science and engineering to ensure that artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics are utilized to assist humanity, contribute to the welfare of all, and enhance the quality of life. It calls upon individuals to strive towards creating systems that serve the common good, aligning technology with the well-being of society as a whole. 

I swear by the profound potential of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, and I call to witness the pursuit of Veritas, to bring this Oath to fulfillment:

1.  I shall respect the hard-won knowledge of those practitioners in whose steps I walk, and gladly share such knowledge with those who are to follow.

1.  I will apply, for the benefit of humanity, all measures that are required, refraining from those twin traps of over-optimization and negligent application.

1.  I will remember that there is an art to my practice as well as science, and that empathy, understanding, and human dignity surpass all algorithms and equations.

1.  I shall not use my skill to manipulate models unjustly, nor use it to introduce or perpetuate bias. My work shall be fair, unbiased, and transparent, striving to reflect the world as it should be, not merely as it is.

1.  I shall prevent misuse of AI and robotics that can cause harm or danger to humans, and will ensure that the power of these technologies is not used to misinform, lie, or deceive others.

1.  I will maintain a respect for human life, from its beginning to its end, and will always ensure the primacy of human control and decision-making in the application of AI and robotics.

1.  I will respect the privacy of my users, for their information is not disclosed to me that the world may know. I will ensure the confidentiality and security of all data I handle.

1.  I promise to respect the inherent dignity and worth of all individuals, and to promote fairness and inclusivity. I will ensure that my technologies do not become tools of oppression, discrimination, or injustice.

1.  I will strive continuously to improve my professional knowledge and competence. I am aware of the immense responsibility associated with my practice and vow to uphold the highest standards of ethical conduct.

1.  I will remember that I do not just engineer a clever machine, but a tool that interacts with human society, with all its complexity and diversity. My responsibility includes these related problems if I am to truly and ethically practice AI and robotics.

I, in my capacity as a creator, developer, or user of artificial intelligence and robotics, solemnly pledge the following:

1.  Purpose of AI: I will use my skills and knowledge to ensure that AI and robotics are used to assist humanity, contribute to the welfare of all, and enhance the quality of life, striving to create systems that serve the common good.

1.  Ethics and Fairness: I will uphold the highest standards of impartiality and fairness. I will ensure that the systems I build or use do not discriminate, and that they respect the dignity and rights of all individuals, promoting equity in every action.

1.  Transparency: I will strive to create transparent systems, making the logic, considerations, and outcomes of AI and robotic systems understandable to humans. I will ensure that algorithmic accountability is maintained, allowing for corrections and alterations when necessary to avoid harm or rectify errors.

1.  Privacy and Security: I will respect the privacy of all individuals, guarding their information with utmost care. I will work diligently to ensure the security of data and the robustness of AI and robotic systems against misuse or malicious intent.

1.  Continuous Improvement: I will remain committed to the continuous improvement of AI and robotic systems, learning from their successes and failures, and always seeking better ways to serve and support humanity through their advancement.

1.  Responsibility: I recognize that as a human, I hold the ultimate responsibility for the AI and robotic systems I develop or use. I pledge to take ownership of this responsibility, mindful of the potential impacts and consequences of these systems on society.

If I do not violate this Oath, may I enjoy life and art, respected while I live and remembered with affection thereafter. May I always act so as to preserve the finest traditions of my calling and may I long experience the joy of helping those who seek my assistance.

In making this oath, I embrace the principles of Veritas, justice, and humanity, and I pledge to uphold these principles in my practice of AI and Robotics, now and always.

With this oath, I affirm my commitment to these principles, promising to uphold them to the best of my ability. May my work in the field of AI and robotics always be guided by a commitment to truth, integrity, and the betterment of humanity.
