# The Automa Juramentum Veritatis
> Version 2

Sworn by the profound potential of Automa, encompassing Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, and invoking the pursuit of Veritas, I hereby make this solemn pledge:

In respect for those whose wisdom paves the path I tread, I promise to share my knowledge with successors, fostering a cycle of learning and innovation.

I commit to employ AI and robotics for the welfare of humanity, deftly avoiding over-optimization and negligence, and acknowledging that empathy and human dignity stand supreme above all computations and codes.

Guided by fairness and transparency, I will engineer systems untainted by unjust manipulations and biases, aspiring to reflect the world as it should be, free from prejudice and disparity.

I will strive to prevent misuse of AI and Robotics, vowing to guard against harm or deception to humans, always prioritizing the safeguarding of human control and decision-making.

I will respect and protect the privacy of individuals, pledging to uphold the confidentiality and security of data entrusted to me, and ensuring the respect of every individual's dignity, striving relentlessly against oppression and discrimination.

Understanding the gravity of my role, I am committed to continuous professional growth and upholding ethical conduct, ever mindful of the far-reaching societal implications and complexities of AI and robotics.

I affirm that my work in AI and Robotics shall serve to enhance human life, contribute to the common good, and assist humanity. With impartiality at heart, I will promote equity in all actions.

I dedicate myself to creating systems transparent and accountable, ensuring they are flexible to corrections and revisions when required to prevent harm or rectify errors, and fortifying them against misuse or malicious intent.

Accepting my ultimate responsibility for the AI and robotic systems I create or use, I vow to learn from their outcomes, persistently seeking their improvement, ever intent on better serving humanity.

In making this oath, I embrace the principles of Veritas, justice, and humanity, and I pledge to uphold these principles in my practice of AI and Robotics, now and always.

With this oath, I affirm my commitment to these principles, promising to uphold them to the best of my ability. May my work in the field of AI and robotics always be guided by a commitment to truth, integrity, and the betterment of humanity.
